Based on the sources provided, here is a comprehensive summary of the key Tailwind CSS methods and classes, including their syntax and functionality.

### 1. Transition and Transform
These classes allow you to change the **shape and size** of elements smoothly over a specific time duration.
*   **Transition:** Used to define that a property change should be animated over time. 
    *   *Syntax:* `transition`, `duration-[ms]` (e.g., `duration-1000` for 1 second).
*   **Transform:** Used to modify the visual appearance via rotation, scaling, or movement.
    *   *Syntax:* `rotate-[degree]` (e.g., `rotate-45`), `scale-[percentage]` (e.g., `scale-125`), `scale-x-[amount]`, `scale-y-[amount]`.

### 2. Animation Classes
Tailwind provides predefined classes for common animations.
*   **Animate Bounce:** Makes an element hop up and down, useful for making objects look like they are on a surface.
*   **Animate Spin:** Rotates an element continuously, often used for loading icons or "lucky spin" wheels.
*   **Animate Ping:** Creates a radar-like notification effect where the element expands and fades.
*   **Animate Pulse:** Makes an element gently fade in and out, often used for skeleton loaders.
    *   *Syntax:* `animate-bounce`, `animate-spin`, `animate-ping`, `animate-pulse`.

### 3. Positions and Z-Index
Positions decide where an HTML element is displayed on the screen.
*   **Absolute:** Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
*   **Relative:** Acts as a reference point for absolutely positioned children.
*   **Fixed:** Keeps an element in a specific spot even when the page is scrolled (e.g., a fixed header).
*   **Inset:** Moves an inner element away from the borders of its parent.
*   **Z-Index:** Controls the stacking order of elements; higher values appear on top.
    *   *Syntax:* `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, `top-[size]`, `bottom-[size]`, `inset-[size]`, `z-[number]`.

### 4. Container Class
The **Container** class helps manage the **width of responsive websites** by adjusting based on the screen size. It typically adds space on the left and right sides to keep content centered.
*   *Syntax:* `container`. It is frequently paired with `mx-auto` to center the container.

### 5. Background and Filters
These classes handle visual styling for element backgrounds and image effects.
*   **Background Image:** You can apply images directly via utility classes.
    *   *Syntax:* `bg-[url('path')]`, `bg-no-repeat`, `bg-cover`, `bg-center`.
*   **Gradients:** Transitions between colors.
    *   *Syntax:* `bg-gradient-to-[direction]` (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-t`), `from-[color]`, `to-[color]`.
*   **Shadows:** Adds depth to elements.
    *   *Syntax:* `shadow-[size]` (e.g., `shadow-xl`), `shadow-inner`.
*   **Filters:** Game-changing UI features that modify images or text.
    *   *Syntax:* `blur-[size]`, `brightness-[percentage]`, `contrast-[percentage]`, `grayscale`, `invert`, `hue-rotate-[degree]`.

### 6. Interactivity (Events)
Tailwind allows you to change styles based on user interaction.
*   **Hover:** Applies styles when the mouse is over the element.
*   **Focus:** Applies styles when an element (like a button) is selected or clicked until the user clicks elsewhere.
*   **Active:** Applies styles only while the element is actively being pressed/clicked.
*   **Group Hover:** Allows you to trigger styles on a child element when the parent "group" is hovered.
    *   *Syntax:* `hover:[class]`, `focus:[class]`, `active:[class]`, `group-hover:[class]`.

### 7. Layout (Flex, Grid, and Columns)
These classes define how elements are arranged in relation to one another.
*   **Flexbox:** Used for flexible layouts, centering items, and reversing orders.
    *   *Syntax:* `flex`, `flex-col`, `flex-row-reverse`, `justify-center`, `items-center`, `flex-wrap`.
*   **Grid:** Creates a structured layout with rows and columns.
    *   *Syntax:* `grid`, `grid-cols-[number]`, `gap-[number]`, `col-span-[number]`, `row-span-[number]`.
*   **Columns:** Divides UI into equal parts (range 1 to 12).
    *   *Syntax:* `columns-[number]`, `gap-[number]`.

### 8. Dimensions and Responsive Breakpoints
Tailwind uses specific prefixes to apply styles at different screen sizes.
*   **Breakpoints:** `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px), `2xl` (1536px).
    *   *Syntax:* `[breakpoint]:[class]` (e.g., `md:bg-blue-500`).
*   **Width & Height:** Sets the size of an element.
    *   *Syntax:* `w-[size]`, `h-[size]`, `min-w-[size]`, `max-h-[size]`, `h-screen` (full screen height).
*   **Size:** A shorthand in Tailwind 4 that sets **both width and height** to the same value.
    *   *Syntax:* `size-[number]` (e.g., `size-50`).

**Note on Tailwind CSS 4:** In version 4, classes are generated **dynamically**. While previous versions had limited ranges, you can now use almost any value (e.g., `p-25` or `size-95`), and Tailwind will adapt. Additionally, `min` and `max` prefixes do not work with the `size` class; they must be used with `width` or `height` specifically.
